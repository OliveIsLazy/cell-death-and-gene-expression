## Thesis Abstract
Apoptosis is the normal process of programmed cell death that every cell can perform, and is a crucial part of maintaining bodily health. Apoptosis typically starts with the mitochondrial membrane permeabilising, which then leads to the activation of caspase enzymes that cause the breakdown of a cell in a controlled fashion. CICD is an alternative form of cell death that occurs in a controlled fashion without engaging with caspase proteins, whether they are absent or have been inactivated. Although the extent of the differences is not fully understood, CICD is known to result in higher rates of inflammation that can promote anti-tumour immunity, making it of medical interest. While apoptosis and CICD are fairly well understood on a cellular level, their impacts on gene-expression have not yet been researched.

RNAseq data from endothelial mouse cells was examined using differential gene analysis as a precursor to enrichment analysis, where 8 enrichment methods with 6 pathway databases were used to systematically identify differentially-enriched genesets. These results were then qualitatively reviewed to find repeated patterns for each of the processes. The genes then had their transcriptional and post-transcriptional features examined.

The overall results show CICD as more frequently associated with genesets relating to immune responses as well as subtle glycolysis and galactose regulation via GAPDH and the *Gale* gene. The presence of AREs largely impacted the patterns in 3'UTR lengths and the proportion of GC bases in 3'UTR sequences. The results suggest that genes with an associated ARE had longer UTR lengths overall. Genes without an associated ARE saw longer UTR lengths and higher GC proportions in the differentially expressed genes, which gives more opportunities to post transcriptional elements to reduce their gene-expression.
